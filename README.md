JHU daSH:

Jeff Leek and Brian Caffo are here intro-ing. First hackathon. Kind of genomics focused. 

Package: googlesheets-pulls data from google sheets to R.

jhudatascience.org

all data: https://github.com/seankross/jhudash


project themes:

Brian Caffo, quantified self: Brian's myfitnesspal data bit.ly/1NEtfSa. Activity monitoring data: bit.ly/1j1gp5b. 

Roger Peng, population health-gauging the health of populations...on the cheap. datasets: NHANES, NHIS, BRESS, General Social Survey. Variables: Environment (Indor, outdoor, built, neighborhood etc), Diet, Behavior, Public policy. Ideas: Descriptive, Natural Experiments, Propose an intervention and predict how well it will go. 

sean Cress, current events: hilary clinton's emails. refugee crisis-humanitarian data sets. college score card. spread of ebola, nepal earthquake effect. 

Leah Jager, civic data: Open Baltimore. Data.gov. Socrata. Open City data. 

Jeff Leek, genetics and genomics: Precision Medicine. ClinVar. openSNP. SRA. Do-it-yourself genetic testing. 


Projects slides from Day 2:

-Predicting Capacity of countries to take in syrian refugees. Both a cost and capacity model. 
-Plotting fitbit activity at time of day and week
-Predicting what genes make mice a good model of human disease
-how the economy affects population health
-return on investments for college
-looking at census data and what does a wholefood's neighborhood look like
-looking spatially at how lead exposure correlates with violent crime
-predicting immunoreactivity of peptides
-bike project
-fracking in pennsylvania
-US-predicting cell-type from gene expression data

Project Summaries:

-Refugee Crisis Modeling-Optimum relocation country and cost model and capacity model and migration model-made Shiny app
-Cost of College-descriptive, exploratory analysis-made shiny app
-Quantified Self-made shiny app describing my fitness pal data
-Lead poisoning and violent crime-correlation
-how can the economy affect wellness?
-instagram post statistics
-compare genes associated with mouse and human phenotypes-lots of fishers exact tests
-scrape fitbit data and make shiny app
-mapping biking conditions based on pot holes etc. and put on shiny app
-immunogenomics group-predicting immunogenecity of peptides-descriptive stats of prroperties
